# UAV-Path-Planning-using-Gray-Wolf-Optimization
* Regenerated a state-of-the-art meta-heuristic algorithm for the UAV path planning problem, proposed by [Qu, Gai, and Zhong](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950705120300356).
* The objective is to find a flyable and smooth path by which the UAV could easily fly from the start to its destination.
