# UAV-Path-Planning-using-Gray-Wolf-Optimization
* Developed a state-of-the-art meta-heuristic algorithm for the UAV path planning problem.
* The objective is to find a flyable and smooth path by which the UAV could easily fly from the start to its destination.
* This repository is part of my master thesis project (it will be updated) !
